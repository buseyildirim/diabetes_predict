# diabetes_predict

### Business Problem : <br>
It is desired to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified.

### Dataset Story

The dataset is part of the large dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the USA. <br>
Data used for diabetes research on Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city of the State of Arizona in the USA.<br>
The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 indicates positive diabetes test result, 0 indicates negative.<br>

Number of variables: 9,
Number of observation : 768

Variables: 
- Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies <br>
- Glucose : 2-hour plasma glucose concentration in the oral glucose tolerance test<br>
- Blood Pressure : Blood Pressure (minor blood pressure) (mm Hg)<br>
- SkinThickness : Skin Thickness<br>
- Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)<br>
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction : Function (2-hour plasma glucose concentration in oral glucose tolerance test)<br>
